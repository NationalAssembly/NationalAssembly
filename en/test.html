In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah!<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,<br>
I seh, logwood burnin' through the nights, yeah!<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, say,<br>
Of which I'll share with you, yeah!<br>
My feet is my only carriage<br>
And so I've got to push on through.<br>
Oh, while I'm gone,<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!<br>

One more time I got to say:<br>
